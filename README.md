# Beam-Alert-Overlay
An alert overlay using streamjar websockets for beam.pro.

This is a base template meant to be modified for individual use. It will not work out of the box as it at least requires a streamjar account and a personal streamjar API key from said account.

This overlay is set up to show a group of three messages every 15 minutes on stream, with the last of those messages showing support for a random person in a list of friends. This will also pull follows, subs, donations, gamewisp subs, and gamewisp resubs from the streamjar API and display notifications. After the notification is shown the event will be placed in a small list at the top right of the stream.

Credit for sounds goes to the wonderful devs who created Darkest Dungeon and these sounds for use on streams.
